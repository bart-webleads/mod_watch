### Wait, what? Why?

As per the wishes of [Anthony Howe](https://twitter.com/SirWumpus) (who is not dead; presumably he simply wishes his Apache modules were) the code mirrored here has been removed. The license explicitly disallowed mirroring it, patching it, updating it, distributing it, looking at it, talking about it, remembering it, compiling it, or generally doing anything in any way interesting with it without the authors written consent, which he declined to provide.

Questions? Direct them to the author. I just work here.
