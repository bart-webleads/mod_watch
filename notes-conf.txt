In both dynamic and static installations, remember to add the 
following to the httpd.conf file as part of the server's global
configuration:

  <IfModule mod_watch.c>
    # Allows the URL used to query virtual host data:
    #
    #	http://www.snert.com/watch-info
    #
    <Location /watch-info>
    SetHandler watch-info
    </Location>

    # Allows the URL used to query file owner and web
    # server data:
    #
    #	http://www.snert.com/~achowe/watch-info
    #	http://www.snert.com/~SERVER/watch-info
    #
    <Location /~*/watch-info>
    SetHandler watch-info
    </Location>
  </IfModule>
